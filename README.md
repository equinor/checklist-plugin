# checklist-plugin
Plugin to handle ProCoSys Checklists

The wrapping application must handle authorization and get hold of the checklists.
This plugin takes a list of checklists ( CPCL / MCCR ) as input and takes care of rendering, filling out and signing them.

It is written in Elm, but meant to be comsumed by anyone. Does not matter if you use React, Angular or Elm
